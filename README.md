# Nifty Sinatra Skeleton

## About
A sinatra skeleton the way I like it.  Here's what you get out of the box:

* Mustache
* CoffeeScript
* Sass
* Thin
* Foreman
* Rspec
* JQuery

If this is how you like your Sinatra apps then feel free to fork and contribute.

## Technical

### Sprockets
Sprockets is used to load all of the scss and coffeescript so you don't have to.

## Installation
    $ git clone https://github.com/spyc3r/NiftySinatraSkeleton.git

### Start server with shotgun
    $ bundle exec shotgun -O config.ru

### Start server with foreman
    $ foreman start
